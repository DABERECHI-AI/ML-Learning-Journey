 ML-Learning-Journey ðŸ“šðŸš€
My 6-month Machine Learning journey from scratch to real world ML projects.


This repository documents my 6-month Machine Learning learning journey from Python & Core Libraries to Math Fundamentals to building ML projects by December 2025.

 ðŸ“… Roadmap
1. Python Basics
2. Math Fundamentals â†’ Algebra, Statistics, Probability (Current Stage)
3. Machine Learning Fundamentals
4. Key Concepts of Deep Learning
5. Learn to Deploy ML models
6. MLOps
7. Specialize

 ðŸ“Œ How This Repo Works
- Each folder = a learning stage.
- Each file = a weekâ€™s progress (notes, code, or projects).
- Updated weekly as I learn and practice.
